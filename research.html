  <h1>Research</h1>
  We are broadly interested in how patterns of genetic variation --- across space and in time -- are shaped jointly by population structure and polygenic selection. Specific areas of research activity include:  
  <p> <b>Barriers to Gene Flow and Speciation</b>  </p>
  We are interested in the processes and genes that contribute to the breakdown of hybridisation during the evolution of distinct species.
  Specifically, we use models to understand how selection acting on multiple genes influences genetic and phenotypic differences between speciating populations, and the extent to which patterns in genomic data can provide
  information about the mechanisms and genes involved in speciation.  
  A key question here is: (when) do individual genes matter? Conversely, when does divergence between populations depend only on a few effective parameters that capture the combined effect of many different barriers? 
  By identifying which parameters and genetic details  we can(not) infer from data, we hope to gain a better understanding of the limits of genomic inference.

  <p> <b>Linkage between genes and the response to selection</b>  </p>
 Quantitative genetics, which is the classical framework for describing short-term evolution, assumes that traits are influenced by many small-effect genetic variants that are unlinked, i.e., inherited independently of each other. 
    However, in most organisms, genes are physically linked across a small number of chromosomes, with large chunks of chromosome passed on intact from parent to offspring.
We are interested in understanding the consequences of  such linkage for the response to selection. 
    <!Specifically, how does linkage between large numbers of genes influence the rate of adaptation and the signatures it leaves in the genomes of populations?>
    A key question here is: does  selection `see' individual genetic variants or only large blocks of genome containing many such (beneficial and deleterious) variants. 
    Furthermore, can we identify selected blocks in genomic data, and what can we learn from them about the strength and targets of selection?
        <img src="Linkage_schematic.png" alt="Linkage" style="width:100%; height:auto; display: block;"> 
  <p> <b>Eco-evolutionary feedback and population extinction</b> </p>
Most models of evolutionary change assume that the size of evolving populations is constant or determined by demographic processes, independently of the genetics of the population. 
  However, this assumption breaks down in small or fragmented populations, which tend to accumulate harmful mutations at a higher rate,  which reduces population fitness and growth,
  which further accelerates the accumulation of harmful variants. This can result in a positive feedback betweeen declining population sizes and increasing genetic load that may eventually lead to population extinction.
  We aim to better understand such eco-evolutionary feedback using more realistic models that account for both genetic and demographic fluctations as well as realistic (polygenic) architectures of fitness variation. The larger goal is to   
quantitatively characterise the conditions for the extinction of fragmented populations across a wide range of scenarios, including both inbreeding and environmental maladaptation.

In addition, we are starting various projects that focus on the genomic signatures of polygenic selection in spatially continuous populations,
  with the aim of better understanding if/how different evolutionary processes can be distinguished in genomic data. More information <a href="genes-in-space.html">here</a>.
