  <p> Himani Sachdeva. <br/>
    I am broadly interested in understanding how genetic variation in natural populations influences short-term adaptation as well as longer-term evolutionary outcomes (local adaptation, speciation, extinction). 
    More specifically, my research focuses on the evolution of complex (polygenic) traits that typically harbour high levels of heritable variation. Selection on such traits usually results 
    in subtle, non-independent changes across very many genes, which can be difficult to detect in genomic data. I use mathematical models and simulations to better understand the genomic signatures of such poygenic
    adaptation. Specific projects focus on the effects of physical linkage between genes, how spatial population structure influences our ability to detect the genes involved in adaptation and speciation, and  eco-evolutionary feedback mediated by complex traits 
    (see Research).    
    <br/> I am currently a university assistant (senior postdoc) in the <a href="https://www.mabs.at/team/"> Mathematics and Biosciences Group</a> at the University of Vienna.
    Beginning October 2025, I will be starting as an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Vienna. 
    I am also a part of the SFB consortium which aims to undertstand polygenic adaptation using a combination of differen approaches -- experimental evolution, genomic analyses of natural population and 
    theoretical modeling.  <br/>
  
 As part of an ERC funded project Genes in Space (starting October 2025), I am looking to recruit multiple PhD students and postdocs (see also Positions). Please get in touch if you are interested!
