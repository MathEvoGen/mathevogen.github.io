    I use mathematical models to understand how genetic variation in natural populations influences short-term response to selection as well as longer-term evolutionary outcomes (local adaptation, speciation, extinction). 
    My research mainly focuses on the evolution of complex (polygenic) traits, most of which harbour high levels of variation. Selection on such traits typically results
    in subtle, non-independent changes across very many genes, which can be difficult to detect in genomic data. I aim to understand how the genomic signatures of such poygenic
    adaptation are influenced by the  genetic architecture of selected traits (the numbers, effect sizes, linkage and pleiotropy of the underlying genes) as well as population processes (including soatial populaiton strcuture).
(see Research for more details).    
    <br/> I am currently a university assistant (senior postdoc) in the <a href="https://www.mabs.at/team/"> Mathematics and Biosciences Group</a> at the University of Vienna.
    Beginning October 2025, I will be starting as an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Vienna. 
    I am also a part of the SFB consortium which aims to undertstand polygenic adaptation using a combination of differen approaches -- experimental evolution, genomic analyses of natural population and 
    theoretical modeling.  <br/>
  
 As part of an ERC funded project Genes in Space (starting October 2025), I am looking to recruit multiple PhD students and postdocs (see also Positions). Please get in touch if you are interested!
