  <p> I use mathematical models to understand how genetic variation is maintained in natural populations, how populations respond to selection (which is  often polygenic, i.e., involving multiple genes), 
    and the longer-term outcomes (local adaptation, speciation, extinction) resulting from the interplay of dispersal, demography and selection over different spatial and temporal scales. 
   </p>

    <p> I studied physics and obtained my PhD in statistical physics from TIFR Mumbai. Motivated by an interest in biodiversity and the processes that maintain it, I then switched to theoretical population and evolutionary genetics for my postdoctoral work at IST Austria. 
    I am currently a university assistant (senior postdoc) in the <a href="https://www.mabs.at/team/"> Mathematics and Biosciences Group</a> at the University of Vienna.
    Beginning October 2025, I will be starting as an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Vienna. 
    I am also a part of an <a href="https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/sfb-polygenic-adaptation"> SFB consortium </a> which consists of various groups in and around Vienna that use different approaches --- 
    experimental evolution, genomic analyses of natural populations and theoretical modeling --- to study polygenic adaptation.  </p>
  
 <p>As part of an ERC funded project   <a href="genes-in-space.html">Genes in Space</a> (starting October 2025),
   I am looking to work together with PhD students and postdocs (see also  <a href="positions.html"> Positions</a>). 
   Please get in touch if you are interested! </p>
