  <h2> Himani Sachdeva. </h2>
  <p> I use mathematical models to understand how genetic variation in natural populations influences the short-term response to selection as well as longer-term evolutionary outcomes (local adaptation, speciation, extinction). 
    My <a href="research.html"> research</a> focuses primarily on the evolution of complex (polygenic) traits, which often harbour high levels of variation. Selection on such traits typically results
    in subtle, non-independent changes across very many genes, which can be difficult to detect in genomic data. The goal of my reseach is to understand how the genomic signatures of such poygenic
    adaptation are influenced by the  genetic architecture of selected traits (the numbers, effect sizes, linkage and pleiotropy of the underlying genes) as well as population processes, especially 
    spatial population structure.</p>

    <p> I studied physics and obtained my PhD in statistical physics from TIFR Mumbai. I then switched to theoretical population and evolutionary genetics for my postdoctoral work at IST Austria. 
    I am currently a university assistant (senior postdoc) in the <a href="https://www.mabs.at/team/"> Mathematics and Biosciences Group</a> at the University of Vienna.
    Beginning October 2025, I will be starting as an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Vienna. 
    I am also a part of an <a href="https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/sfb-polygenic-adaptation"> SFB consortium on polygenic adaptation</a> which consists of multiple groups combining different approaches --- 
    experimental evolution, genomic analyses of natural populations and theoretical modeling --- to study polygenic adaptation.  </p>
  
 <p>As part of an ERC funded project   <a href="genes-in-space.html">Genes in Space</a> (starting October 2025),
   I am looking to recruit multiple PhD students and postdocs (see also  <a href="positions.html"> Positions</a>). 
   Please get in touch if you are interested! </p>
