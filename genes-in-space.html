  <h1>GenesInSpace</h1>
  <p> Rapid advances in sequencing have made an unprecedented amount of genomic data available from diverse organisms. 
    However, extracting useful information from this data, e.g., about how evolutionary processes shape genetic variation and/or how genes influence individual phenotypes, remains challenging.  
    While numerous tools of genomic prediction, notably <b>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)</b>, have been developed in recent years, a common and unsolved challenge is to disentangle the 
    signatures of different evolutionary processes in genomic variation. In particular, genetic differences between groups of individuals may reflect either <b>natural selection</b>
    (typically on highly polygenic traits) or <b>spatial population structure</b> (i.e., limited exchange of individuals and genes between geographically distant groups) or both. 
    Moreover, both selection and population structure generate <b>correlations along the genome</b>, making it difficult to fine-map the individual genetic variants that affect traits.
  <br/>    <br/>  
The ERC-funded project "Genes in Space" aims to  develop new develop new theoretical frameworks to understand how natural selection acting on multiple genes in spatially extended populations shapes patterns of genetic variation 
    &mdash; both along the genome and across geographic space. Building upon this, we will investigate whether and how selection and population structure can be disentangled in GWAS, and how selection affects the power of GWAS and
the portability of GWAS findings between different populations. The goal is to arrive at a more systematic understanding of the power and <i>limits</i> of sequence data for identifying functionally important regions of the genome (e.g., those that 
    influence disease risk in humans, yield in crops and environmental maladaptation in endangered populations).
