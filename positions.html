  <h1>Positions</h1>
  <p> As part of the ERC-funded project Genes in Space, we have multiple openings for PhDs and postdocs at the University of Vienna. 
    While most of our work is theoretical, there is ample scope to develop projects at the theory-data interface, potentially together with collaborators working on genomic inference in natural populations.   
    If you are interested, please write to himani.sachdeva@univie.ac.at with a CV and a brief statment of research interests.   </p>
